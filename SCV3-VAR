    YOU ARE WARRANTED UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THIS SCRIPT UNTIL KAH GETS DISCONTINUED OR CLOSED IF YOU ARE WHITELISTED

    This script has no GUI
    This script can be customized up to a very great extent
    Hints on how to use the script can be found in-game
    Feel free to ask @Tech ANY questions related to this script. Please don't hesitate

    Run v!cmds in the chat or in system chat for a list of commands
    Run v!editor to access the command editor
    Run v!buildgui to access another part of the script

    TOS:
    No refunds. If an executor can't run this script then that's not our fault. Blame the executor for that and not us. This script wouldn't be available if it didn't work since it's a live-service script

    Please don't steal one of our methods without crediting the founders or creators. Yeah I can't entirely prevent this but at the very least be ethical about it

    This is a live-service script which means it can be discontinued at any time, however you are warranted to keep a version of this exact script forever if we do discontinue. (Either the source gets released or it just becomes obfuscated and free, meanwhile the creator(s) disappear)

    You can abuse with this script pretty much all you want, however I'm still kindly asking you to be respectful towards other SCV3-VAR users

    You can request an account to be unwhitelisted at nearly any time, as long as we don't find out a suspicious pattern

    Don't tamper with the script's security

    Do not attempt to downgrade this script to an earlier version, as that is a form of tampering. If you don't like the changes made in an update then reach out to @Tech instead as decisions are made with very good reasons, and if something randomly changed in an update then that has a good reason, it usually has to do with executor compatibility and then something accidentally breaks for others, but yeah

    Downtime can happen (sometimes), while I do aim for 100% uptime, it's sometimes bound to happen under certain circumstances. Pay attention to every end of each month

    This script is mostly QOL and not really focused towards cheating. We're trying to give you a better KAH experience.
    KAH is fun. Respect agspureiam
